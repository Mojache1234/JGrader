                <h3>About</h3>
                jGrader is a cloud based grading system designed for use within a high school AP Computer Science program.
                The system allows teachers to easily collect, grade, and provide feedback on assignments.
                Teachers can execute code submitted by their students <em>directly</em> in their browsers.
                It's easy to use and allows teachers to focus on what they do best - teach!

                <h3>History</h3>
                jGrader was started by Brian Singer and Greg Carlin, two teaching assistants for an AP Computer Science class in Armonk, New York.
                The original idea came from the computer science teacher at the local high school, who was tired of the tediousness he dealt with when grading AP Computer Science assignments.
                Now, jGrader can help you too focus on your students' success.

                <h3>Automatic Testing</h3>
                jGrader has the ability to create test-cases for each assignment. After the teacher creates the test-cases, the teacher has ability to automatically run students' code against each case.
                This allows for teachers to see if a program is written correctly and/or properly handles edge cases.
                Autograding is flexible, powerful, and does the busy work for you.

                <h3>Anti-Plagiarism</h3>
                Ensure that students are not copying each other or getting their solutions online.
                Utilizes algorithms specifically designed for reviewing Java code in an AP Computer Science setting.

                <h3>Commenting</h3>
                jGrader has line-by-line commenting that allows for teachers to tell their students how they can improve their code.
                Leave comments on sections of their code, and provide suggestions that will help them get a 5 on the AP exam.

                <h3>Teaching Assistants</h3>
                Set up teaching assistants to help out in class.
                If given permission, assistants can comment on students' code as well as grade assignments.
