      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        When you register for jGrader, we collect your email, password, and full name.
        We also use Google Analytics to keep track of traffic, which collects information already sent by the browser to our servers.
        Use of this site is an implicit agreement for this anonymous data to be aggregated.
        jGrader collects student's submissions to assignments.
        The student retains the rights to these submitted works and we will not use them for purposes other than those requested by the teacher of that student's class.
        Assignment titles, descriptions, and test cases are also owned by the teacher who created them.
        We will not reproduce these without permission from the teacher.
        When a user submits feedback to jGrader, we also record browser and operating system information in order to more accurately fix bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        All information is stored in a secure MySQL database, the industry standard for data storage.
        Account passwords are hashed and salted, which means that even if the database is compromised, user accounts will not be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        jGrader uses cookies to keep users logged in.
        Clicking "Log out" will delete these cookies from a user's computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Location Information</h2>
        jGrader does not directly collect location information. Some location data is inferred by Google Analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Disclosure</h2>
        Information that is collected from users is never disclosed to any individual who does not work for jGrader.
        The only exception is the collection of demographic data done by Google Analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Deletion</h2>
        Some data, like assignments and classes, can be deleted from jGrader by clicking the trash can icon.
        If you wish to delete other data, like user accounts, please email <a href="mailto:contact@jgrader.com">contact@jgrader.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Access</h2>
        All data that is stored in relation to your user account can be viewed through the standard jGrader web interface, with the exception of past feedback.
        If you would like to see this data, please email <a href="mailto:contact@jgrader.com">contact@jgrader.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Young People</h2>
        jGrader is designed to be used by students of all ages.
        We do not collect age data upon sign up, or at any other time.
        If you are a parent that wishes to remove your child's account, please email <a href="mailto:contact@jgrader.com">contact@jgrader.com</a>.
        All internal aspects of jGrader are appropriate for all age groups, but we are not responsible for the appropriateness of user-uploaded content.
        A student's exposure to user-uploaded content is limited to their teacher's assignments and uploaded code.
        Students will only see the assignments created by the teachers of classes they are enrolled in.
        Students can only join a class via a class code provided by the teacher. There is no class browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        jGrader is still a fairly new website, and its privacy policy must change as new features are added.
        Use of the website implies an agreement to this version of the policy as well as any future version.
        The privacy policy is subject to change at any time.
