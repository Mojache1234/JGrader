      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <ul class="left">
        <li>
          <h2>How much does jGrader cost?</h2>
          jGrader is currently free for use until August 1, 2015. Our final pricing policy is still under review.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>What programming languages are supported?</h2>
          Currently only Java is supported, because this is the only language tested on the CollegeBoard's AP Computer Science exam.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>What features of Java are supported?</h2>
          Almost all features of Java are supported, with the exception of a small few. Packages are not supported due to implementation complexities. Additionally, executed code is run with a Security Manager that disables certain features for security reasons.
          These disabled features include reading and writing files and accessing system information. Most of the Java library, including Scanners and ArrayLists, are supported.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Is there a maximum runtime for code execution?</h2>
          Code that runs for longer than 10 seconds is terminated. This is to prevent infinite loops and the potential hogging of resources.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="middle">
        <li>
          <h2>What version of Java is supported?</h2>
          We currently run code through Java 1.6.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Has this system been tested within a real classroom setting?</h2>
          jGrader underwent an alpha stage within the AP Computer Science class at Byram Hills High School throughout the 2014-2015 school year. As we approach the end of this school year, we are opening the website up for general use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Why don't you have feature X?</h2>
          Probably because we haven't thought of it. We are still new and are very open to new ideas. Please <a href="mailto:contact@jgrader.com" target="_blank">tell us more</a>!
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Is there a free trial period?</h2>
          Currently jGrader is free for all users. After August 1, we will offer a 30 day free trial period.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="right">
        <li>
          <h2>How can I add students to my class?</h2>
          On a page for a given class, you can find a class code. If you give this code to your students, they will be able to sign up for your class via their class list.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Can students submit assignments after they are due?</h2>
          Students can continue to submit and resubmit assignments after their due dates, but they will automatically be marked as late.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>So how can I sign up?</h2>
          Just fill out the form <a href="/sign-up">here</a>.
        </li>
