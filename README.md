# JGrader
A tool designed to be used in an AP Computer Science classroom that allows teachers to easily collect and grade work.

Teachers can create assignments, which students can then submit code to.
Teachers can then execute the code (with different inputs) right from their browsers.
No need to go through the hassle of copying and pasting code from emails.

Can be seen live at http://jgrader.com

Planned features:
* Autograding - automatically run test cases, and assign grades based on those test cases
* Commenting - teachers and TAs can comment on students' code, helping them improve
* Anti-Plagiarism - check submitted code against what has already been submitted and what is available online, and catch plagiarizers

*Redesign coming very soon!*
